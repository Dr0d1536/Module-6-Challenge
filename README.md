## Temperature vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
## Northern Hemisphere vs Temperature
Shows a negative linear correlation between the Northern Hemisphere and temperature.  Meaning when the the Latitude increases, the temperature decreases. The graph shows a stronge correlation since the points are grouped tightly around the regression line.  The r-values is 0.8 which also supports this claim
## Southern Hemisphere vs Temperature
Shows a positive linear correlation between the Southern Hemisphere and temperature.  Mean the Latitude increases, the temperature increases as well. The graph shows a weak correlation since the points are less grouped near the regression line.  The r-values is 0.4 which shows a weaker realtion ship between temp and lat

## Humidity vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
## Northern Hemisphere vs Humidity
Illustrates a weak positive correlation between humidity and northern latitudes.  With the r-value of .4 also supports the graph's findings. 
## Southern Hemisphere vs Humidity
There is even a weaker positive correlation between latitude and humidity in the Southern Hemisphere. The r-value is smaller with a score of 3.

## Cloudiness vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
## Northern Hemisphere vs Cloudiness
Illustrates a weak positive correlation between cloudiness and northern latitudes.  With the r-value of .2 also supports the graph's findings. 
## Southern Hemisphere vs Cloudiness
There is even a weaker positive correlation between latitude and cloudiness in the Southern Hemisphere. The r-value is similar to the Norther results with a score of .2 as well.

## Wind vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
## Northern Hemisphere vs Wind
The has a greater number of data which illistrate a weak positive relation with an r-value of .2. 
## Southern Hemisphere vs Wind
Has a smaller dataset which illistrate a weak positive relation with an r-value of .1.
